=== Phase 15: Deferred Task Execution ===

GHC Capabilities: 4
OpenMP threads:   4

--- Task scaling: sequential vs deferred tasks ---
  Tasks    | Sequential   | Parallel     | Speedup 
  ---------|--------------|--------------|----------
      100 |      1.5 ms  |      0.4 ms  |  3.81x
      500 |      7.7 ms  |      2.5 ms  |  3.12x
     1000 |     15.6 ms  |      5.0 ms  |  3.12x
     5000 |     78.1 ms  |     19.9 ms  |  3.93x
    10000 |    155.9 ms  |     42.6 ms  |  3.66x

--- Analysis ---
  Tasks are created by one thread (#pragma omp single) and
  executed by all threads via task stealing in barriers.
  Speedup scales with thread count for independent tasks.
