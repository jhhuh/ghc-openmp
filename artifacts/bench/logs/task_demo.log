=== Phase 15: Deferred Task Execution ===

GHC Capabilities: 4
OpenMP threads:   4

--- Task scaling: sequential vs deferred tasks ---
  Tasks    | Sequential   | Parallel     | Speedup 
  ---------|--------------|--------------|----------
      100 |      1.1 ms  |      0.3 ms  |  3.85x
      500 |      5.7 ms  |      1.5 ms  |  3.93x
     1000 |     10.8 ms  |      3.6 ms  |  3.03x
     5000 |     55.5 ms  |     15.5 ms  |  3.58x
    10000 |    111.1 ms  |     29.4 ms  |  3.77x

--- Analysis ---
  Tasks are created by one thread (#pragma omp single) and
  executed by all threads via task stealing in barriers.
  Speedup scales with thread count for independent tasks.
