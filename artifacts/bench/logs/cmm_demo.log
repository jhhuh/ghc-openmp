=== Phase 10: Cmm Primitives — Calling Convention Benchmark ===

  Cmm prim:   cap_no = 3
  Unsafe FFI: thread_num = 0, num_procs = 12
  Safe FFI:   thread_num = 0

--- Calling convention overhead (best of 5, interleaved) ---
  prim:      0.0 ns/call  (100000000 iters)
  unsafe:    2.3 ns/call  (10000000 iters)
  safe:     66.6 ns/call  (1000000 iters)

--- Overhead ratios ---
  unsafe/prim: 12917787.2x
  safe/prim:   370117500.0x
  safe/unsafe:  28.7x

--- Interpretation ---
  prim:   ~0.0 ns  (Cmm: register read, no FFI boundary)
  unsafe: ~2 ns  (C call: STG register save/restore)
  safe:   ~67 ns  (+ suspendThread/resumeThread)

=== Done ===
