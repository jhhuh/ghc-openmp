# ghc-openmp devlog

## 2026-02-16: Project bootstrap

Set up nix flake with GHC 9.10.3, GCC 15.2.0, Clang, libomp, perf, gdb.
Created planning artifact for GHC-as-OpenMP-runtime exploration.

## 2026-02-16: Phase 1 — Research and ABI stub

**GHC RTS internals**: `cap->no` maps to `omp_get_thread_num()`,
`getNumCapabilities()` maps to `omp_get_num_threads()`, workers pin via
`rts_setInCallCapability()` + `rts_lock()`.

**libgomp ABI**: Full libgomp has ~280 symbols, basic program only needs 9.
Wrote stub `ghc_omp_runtime.c` implementing GOMP_* symbols with pthreads.
Fixed `GOMP_single_start` race (needed per-team counter + startup barrier).

**Decision**: Selected Option D (Hybrid C shim + GHC RTS) — C shim translates
GOMP_* ABI to GHC RTS calls, using one-OS-thread-per-Capability as worker pool.
